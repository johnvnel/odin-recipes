    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gyro is a popular Greek dish made of seasoned meat, typically lamb, beef, or chicken, that is cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The meat is traditionally seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices like oregano, garlic, and cumin. It is thinly sliced and served in a warm pita bread, often accompanied by fresh toppings like tomatoes, onions, and a creamy, tangy tzatziki sauce made of yogurt, cucumber, and garlic. Gyro is a flavorful and satisfying meal, commonly enjoyed as a quick lunch or dinner. Its combination of savory meat, fresh veggies, and rich sauce makes it a beloved street food worldwide.</p>

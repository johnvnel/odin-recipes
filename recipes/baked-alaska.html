    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked Alaska is a dramatic and indulgent dessert that combines cake, ice cream, and meringue. A layer of sponge cake or biscuit forms the base, topped with a scoop of ice cream. The entire creation is then covered with a thick layer of meringue and quickly baked in a hot oven, just enough to brown the meringue without melting the ice cream inside. The contrast between the warm, toasted meringue and the cold ice cream makes Baked Alaska a show-stopping dessert. It’s often served on special occasions, offering a delightful combination of textures and temperatures that make each bite a unique experience.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <h4>Prepare the cake:</h4>
                <p>Preheat your oven according to the cake mix instructions. Prepare the sponge cake by following the directions on the box (or make a homemade version). Once baked, allow it to cool completely.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <h4>Prepare the ice cream layer:</h4>
                <p>Line a bowl (or a small dish) with plastic wrap. Scoop ice cream into the bowl and press it into the shape of a dome. Freeze for several hours or overnight until firm.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <h4>Assemble the Baked Alaska:</h4>
                <p>Cut the cooled cake into a circle slightly larger than the ice cream dome. Place the cake on a baking sheet. Unmold the ice cream onto the cake.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>

                <h4>Make the meringue:</h4>
                <p>Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a clean bowl until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and vanilla extract, and continue beating until stiff peaks form.</p>

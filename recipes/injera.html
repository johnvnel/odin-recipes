    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Injera is a traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean flatbread that serves as both a base and utensil for meals. Made from teff flour, it has a unique spongy texture and a slightly sour taste, which is a result of the fermentation process. The bread is cooked on a large, flat griddle, creating a soft, porous surface with small holes, perfect for soaking up the rich stews and sauces common in Ethiopian cuisine. Injera is typically served as a large, communal platter, with various dishes such as doro wat (chicken stew) or misir wat (lentil stew) placed on top. It’s not just a side dish, but an integral part of the meal, with the bread used to scoop up flavorful bites of food.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups teff flour (preferably whole-grain)</li>

        <li>1 and a 1/2 cup of water (more or less as needed)</li>

        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>

        <li>1 tsp baking soda (optional for extra rise)</li>

        <li>1 tsp active dry yeast (optional, for fermentation)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

                <h4>Prepare the batter:</h4>
                <p>In a bowl, mix the teff flour, water, salt, and yeast (if using). The batter should be pourable but thick. Let it sit at room temperature for 1-3 days to ferment (if not using yeast, fermentation happens naturally). You’ll know it's ready when it develops a slight sour smell.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <h4>Make the injera:</h4>
                <p>Heat a non-stick or cast iron skillet (called a mitad) over medium-high heat. Lightly grease it with oil or butter. Pour a thin layer of the batter onto the skillet, swirling to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook until small bubbles appear on the surface, indicating it’s ready to be removed. The bottom should be lightly browned.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <div>
                <h4>Finish the injera:</h4>
                <p>Carefully remove the injera and place it on a flat surface to cool. It will continue to soften and become more pliable as it cools. Repeat with the remaining batter.</p>
            </div>

        <li>
            <div>
                <h4>Serve:</h4>
                <p>Injera is typically served as a large flatbread on a platter, with stews and dishes piled on top. It can also be used as a utensil for scooping up food.</p>
